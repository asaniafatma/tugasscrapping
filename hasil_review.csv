Depot Sukses,nn,5.0,"From this previous building to this new building. This restaurant has moved from a building that looks like a house in an alley to a bigger building that looks more like a restaurant, with a modern themed building, this restaurant is much better and a cozy place with affordable price of foods and beverages."
Depot Sukses,Margaretha Dewi,4.0,"A-not-too-big-place for dine in. Avoid the crowded time, cause the place is hot enough. Food and beverages are quite nice. It is a good choice for the one who really hungry. The taste is so so (for me)"
Depot Sukses,Widi Yatno,5.0,"The taste is unique, but not that authentic Japanese, it is more like HokBen. It has special sauce that you can't find in any other place. Price is afordable!, cash payment only, can not debit/cashless, avail on grab & gojek apps, limited street motor/car parking. Their guard so fluffyy anabul üòç"
Depot Sukses,Fatmalia Khoirunnisa,5.0,"it was really nice and pleasure to try this delicious and cheap food. well recomended to be tried by you.I ordered special 1 and 2 menu, and it was really nice."

Depot Sukses,Sam buddy,4.0,Delicious food upgrade place‚Ä¶
Depot Sukses,S. Diana (Shashi Diana),5.0,"Best deals ever. From the taste and price, it's really top notch eventhough the taste not as authentic as Japanese restaurant. However the place isn't cozy and tidy, I suggest to takeaway your order, the the taste might better dine - in though ."
Depot Sukses,Fianna Witwicky,4.0,"Serving delicious food and worth price, but i don't really like the place, the room is always too narrow at every its branches."
Depot Sukses,Ade Rahma Indira,4.0,Super affordable with yummy taste. It has quite a long queue especially during lunchtime or dinner. You can choose the room with AC or without it.
Depot Sukses,An Widi17,5.0,the taste of the cuisine is very good. the place is always crowded. however the place is quite dirty.

Depot Sukses,Dini Masak,4.0,"Delicious food and hospitality, but the place was small for those crowd. You have to wait for seats if you come in late after lunch or dinner time, it was so crowded."
Depot Sukses,Pinecone Archon,3.0,"The place is somewhat difficult to find if you're not familiar with the area or not using map. Motorbike parking is fine but it's a little difficult for car parking. Everyone in town is so hyped about the food, but to my taste buds, they taste just okay, not special. The fried items (tempura, katsu, and other japanese fries) are okay. And by okay, I mean well, they're edible. While the sauteed dishes (yakiniku, teriyaki, bulgogi, and stuffs) are meh, they lack seasoning and definitive taste. And if you order them with rice, they will serve the dish and the rice in one plate, leaving you with soggy rice for dinner. Well, afterall it's still the place to go if you want some cheap Asian cuisines in Semarang, though."
Depot Sukses,Aufa Nuhaismah,5.0,"the taste is good, the location is a bit difficult to reach. standard price. looks attractive."
Depot Sukses,Nurhadi Adi Andoyo,5.0,"I love this place. This place served delicious food with cheap price. Don't come at that place alone, or you'll feel lonely.

Depot Sukses,Raden Arief Nugroho,4.0,"Good place if you want to try cheap Japanese-like food. The food is a bit sweet to me. No sushi/ramen. Katsu and Teriyaki are their specialties.

Depot Sukses,Dita,4.0,"Depot Sukses or also known as DeSu is a famous eating spots for college students who want to eat delicious Japanese fusion food in a more affordable price. It is located a bit far from the main road and with no clear name sign, so you better to rely on your map to find the place otherwise, you can miss it easily. It serves fusion Japanese food and some steaks too. They even have some cheaper packages that's really good if you want to order a lot. It is very crowded during lunch and super popular with the online drivers since many people order the food via online driver app. The stall in Erlangga is cleaner than the one near Gajahmada street and it is on permanent building, too."

Depot Sukses,Dr. Chem,5.0,"(Translated by Google) Food stalls with Japanese menu concepts such as katsu, yakiniku, and bulgogi. There is a menu of chicken, and meat complemented by a salad with a distinctive fresh mayo sauce. Japanese street food stalls with flavors that match the Indonesian tongue. When visiting there we waited for orders for about 15-20 minutes, and it happened to be a busy dinner time. We ordered a budget package and a special package with grass jelly drinks. For the place, it's not that big, sometimes there is a waiting list during busy dinner hours. So you can't linger when you eat there because it's changing with other visitors. (Original) Warung makan dengan konsep menu jepang seperti katsu, yakiniku, dan bulgogi. Tersedia menu ayam, dan daging dilengkapi dengan salad dengan saus mayo segar yang khas. Warung makan jepang kaki lima dengan rasa yang cocok dengan lidah orang Indonesia. Ketika berkunjung ke sana kami menunggu pesanan sekitar 15 - 20 menit, dan kebetulan waktu jam padat makan malam. Kami memesan paket hemat dan paket special dengan minuman es cincau. Untuk tempat memang tidak begitu besar, kadang waiting list ketika jam-jam padat makan malam. Jadi tidak bisa berlama-lama ketika makan disana karena gantian dengan pengunjung lain."
Depot Sukses,Dinar Anata,5.0,"(Translated by Google) Finally got to eat here too. The impression is crowded as soon as you enter and it turns out that the service is fast and swift. I like the salad the most. It's fresh and the mayo is really good. The price is very affordable, it's just that the place is not comfortable but it's okay because the food is all delicious. (Original) Akhirnya ngerasain juga makan disini. Kesannya ramai begitu masuk dan termyata pelayanannya termasuk cepat dan sigap. Paling suka sama saladnya. Seger dan mayonya enak banget. Harga sangat terjangkau, cuma tempatnya aja yang krang nyaman tapi it's oke karena makanannya enak semua."
Depot Sukses,Nilam C Sukma,4.0,"(Translated by Google) The experience of eating Japanese menu food, street food prices and the taste does not disappoint. Worth to buy because the service is also fast. It feels like it has been adapted to the tongue of the Indonesian people. It's just that the dining area is not too wide, so if it's crowded, you have to be patient waiting for a seat. (Original) Pengalaman makan makanan menu jepang, harga kaki lima dan rasa tidak mengecewakan. Worth to buy soalnya pelayanan juga cepat. Rasanya memang seperti sudah disesuaikan lidah orang indonesia. Hanya saja tempat makannya tidak terlalu luas, jadi jika sedang ramai ya memang harus sabar menanti tempat duduk."
Depot Sukses,Meiana Indah S,5.0,"(Translated by Google) This is a food stall whose menu is Japanese food, yes, the place is simple, unfortunately the heat is narrow :( But there's no need to doubt it anymore when it comes to taste and price, I swear I really have to come here to always make you collect me üëçüíú (Original) ini warung makan yg menunya japanes food ya, tempatnya sederhana sayangnya panas sempit :( tp ga usah diraguin lg kalo soal rasa dan harga sumpah benerbener harus wajib bgt ke sini selalu bikin nagihüò≠üëçüíú"
Depot Sukses,a little jingga,5.0,"(Translated by Google) The best place if you want to eat hokben-style or street-style japanese food, the price is quite affordable, I like the beef/chicken teriyaki, so that you can save on the pahe menu, you can get several kinds of food in one menu. (Original) Tempat terbaik kalo mau makan ala hokben atau japanesefood ala kaki lima, harganya cukup terjangkau, suka sama beef/chicken teriyakinya, biar hemat pilih menu pahe dapat bbrp macam dalam satu menu minusnya tempatnya sempit, panas, dan kurang tertata rapi"
Depot Sukses,Rangga Raka Siwi,4.0,"(Translated by Google) The menu choices are varied, yesterday I tried the bento. Cheap prices and filling. The place is like an ordinary shop.

Depot Sukses,Aulia Rachel,4.0,"(Translated by Google) Usually buy via app... When it's noon, try to come directly to the outlet... maybe if it's at the outlet it's not comfortable to eat on the spot If the place is still said to be good, the one in brumbungan, if the one in Erlangga is not, it just smells like sour kringet, it's crazy For a cheap price, because student subscriptions are also online, there are definitely lots of online ojol2 places... (Original) Biasa beli di via aplikasi... Pas siang pgn coba langsung dtg ke outlet...mungkin kalo di outlet kurang nyaman untuk langsung makan di tempat Kalo tmpt masih dibilang lumayan yg di brumbungan,kalo yg di erlangga beuhh baru masuk bau asem kringet gilakk Untuk harga murah,karna langganan mahasiswa juga onlineny jg rame jd pasti tmptny byk ojol2 online..."
Depot Sukses,Rossy Rusfiana,5.0,"(Translated by Google) Katsu is my mainstay in Semarang. It tastes good, the portion is enough to make you full, moreover the salad can be delicious or not bitter. It&#39;s a bit uncomfortable with the room which is a bit stuffy. (Original) Katsu andalan saya kalau di semarang. Rasanya enak, porsi cukup bikin kenyang, apalagi saladnya bisa enak gak pait. Agak kurang nyaman aja sama ruangannya yg agak pengap."
Depot Sukses,Nur Purwa Hidayatun,5.0,"(Translated by Google) The place is simple but the taste of the food is not simple, it's delicious, this is the definition of a street vendor that costs seven stars.

Depot Sukses,Kaguya Ruku,4.0,"(Translated by Google) Food stalls that serve typical Japanese processed foods such as katsu, bento and steak with a variety of economical package options so they can adjust the budget. Sauces used for steak (beef & chicken) are teriyaki sauce, yakiniku and bulgogi. For the chicken steak, the meat is thick, the crust is crispy. The price is friendly in the bag. The place is strategic but not too broad. There is parking. (Original) Warung makan yang menyajikan makanan olahan khas Jepang seperti katsu, bento dan steak dengan berbagai pilihan paket ekonomis sehingga bisa menyesuaikan budget. Saos yang dipakai untuk steak (beef & chicken) yaitu saos teriyaki, yakiniku dan bulgogi. Untuk chicken steaknya dagingnya tebal, kulit tepungnya pun krispi. Harganya ramah di kantong. Tempatnya strategis namun tidak terlalu luas. Ada parkir."
Depot Sukses,Istii,4.0,"(Translated by Google) Yoshinoya is like this in terms of five feet The price is cheap, too The lack of a narrow place is not clean according to me. Many of the places to eat on the outskirts of the place are clean üòä I don't know because it's too crowded or what Oh yeah if it's lazy for a little beef it's finished so if you want to try the beef, it's early. Recommended for college children boarding children who want to eat well but the price is cheap üòÅ Hopefully the level will be more service. (Original) Yoshinoya ala kaki lima ini menurutkuüòÅ Harga nya murah enak juga Kurangnya tempat nya sempit kurang bersih juga menurut ku. Banyak kok tempat makan di pinggiran yang tempat nya bersih üòä Nggak tau karena terlalu rame atau gimana Oiya kalo malem dikit beef nya udah habis jadi kalo mau nyobain beef nya lebih awal datangnya. Recommended buat anak kuliah anak kos yang mau makan enak tapi harganya murah üòÅ Semoga lebih di tingkat kan lagi pelayanan nya."
Depot Sukses,Kunti Fadhila,4.0,"(Translated by Google) The location is quite strategic. It's just that the place is too small and cramped, hot, the dining table is dirty because it's not cleaned. Come here when lunch time is quite crowded, the wait is not too fast too long. But the overall menu is ok, eating 1 portion like this is quite full. The seasoning is really good too. Suitable for lunch, can be wrapped to take home too (Original) Lokasi nya lumayan strategis. Hanya saja tempatnya terlalu kecil dan sempit, panas , meja makan kotor krn tidak dibersihkan. Kesini waktu jam makan siang lumayan rame, nunggu nya juga standar ga lama ga cepet juga. Tapi overall menu nya enaakk, makan 1 porsi gini udah cukup kenyang. Bumbu nya juga kerasa banget. Cocok lah buat makan siang, bisa dibungkus untuk bawa pulang juga"
Depot Sukses,nay,4.0,"(Translated by Google) Japanese-style restaurant with no doubt about the taste the taste is great, the portion is also good, don't be stingy about giving cheese or other toppings. all menus are recommended unfortunately the place is a bit dirty, maybe because the waiter is always busy because the place is always busy (Original) resto ala jepang yang tidak diragukan lagi soal rasanya rasanya mantap, porsinya juga mantap, ga pelit ngasih keju ataupun toping lainnya. semua menunya recommended sayangnya tempatnya agak kotor, mungkin karena pelayannya sibuk terus karena tempatnya juga selalu ramai"

Depot Sukses,Rizki Syamsiyah,5.0,"(Translated by Google) A successful depot, a small roadside stall but never empty of visitors. Why? Because in addition to fit on the tongue, the price is cheap. The audience is diverse, ranging from the lower class, to the upper middle class. It's true that the place is 'less' comfortable, but that doesn't mean it's for hungry fighters. Well, this shop can prove the slogan ""because taste never lies!"". Come on, fans of oriental cuisine, you can stop by to prove it with your own tongue."" (Original) Depot sukses, warung kecil pinggir jalan tapi ga pernah sepi pengunjung. Kenapa? Karena selain cocok di lidah, harganya pun murah meriah. Penikmatnya beragam, mulai dari kalangan bawah, sampai menengah ke atas. Memang sih untuk tempatnya 'kurang' nyaman, tapi itu ga berarti buat para pejuang lapar. Nah, warung ini bisa buktiin slogan ""karena rasa ga pernah bohong!"". Yuk para penggemar masakan oriental, boleh mampir untuk buktiin pake lidah kalian masing"". üòé"

Depot Sukses,Giovani Caesaria,4.0,"(Translated by Google) If it's a laper, it's the right place. Large portions with very affordable prices around 17-30 thousand. The price of drinks is also cheap. It's just that when it's crowded (usually always crowded, rivals with grabfood too) the queue is really good, so I have to be patient. The location is very hot, stuffy, and cleanliness is not maintained. Maybe it can be repaired in the future :) (Original) Kalau lagi laper banget, di sini tempat yang tepat. Porsinya banyak dengan harga sangat terjangkau sekitar 17-30ribu. Harga minuman juga murah. Hanya saja kalau sedang ramai (biasanya selalu rame sih, saingan sama grabfood jg) antrinya lama bangeeeet jadi kudu sabar. Untuk lokasi sangat panas, sumpek, dan kebersihan kurang terjaga. Mungkin bisa diperbaiki lagi ke depannya :)"
